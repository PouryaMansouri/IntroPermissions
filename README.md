## üëã Introduction

Hey there! I see that you're working on a custom authentication project in Django and have implemented custom user and group models. Nice job! I'm happy to help you understand the `permissions` field in the `CustomGroup` model and show you how to use it in your views and templates.

## üßê Understanding the `permissions` Field

In your `CustomGroup` model, you've defined three custom permissions: `change_user`, `view_user`, and `delete_user`. These permissions allow users in the group to update, view, and delete user profiles, respectively. 

## üíª Using the `CustomGroup` Permissions

To use the permissions defined in the `CustomGroup` model, you can associate the group with one or more users using Django's built-in `Group` and `Permission` models. 

Here's an example of how to assign the `CustomGroup` permissions to a user in a view and check if the user has the `view_user` permission in a template:

```python
# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import permission_required
from myapp.models import CustomUser, CustomGroup

@login_required
@permission_required('myapp.view_user', raise_exception=True)
def user_detail(request, user_id):
    user = CustomUser.objects.get(id=user_id)
    return render(request, 'user_detail.html', {'user': user})
```

In the above code, we've defined a view called `user_detail` that's decorated with two decorators: `login_required` and `permission_required`. The `login_required` decorator ensures that the user is logged in before they can access the view, while the `permission_required` decorator checks that the user has the `view_user` permission defined in `CustomGroup`.

Here's an example of how to use the `CustomGroup` permissions in a Django model class view:

```python
# views.py
from django.views.generic import DetailView
from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin, PermissionRequiredMixin
from myapp.models import CustomUser

class CustomUserDetailView(LoginRequiredMixin, PermissionRequiredMixin, DetailView):
    model = CustomUser
    template_name = 'user_detail.html'
    context_object_name = 'user'
    permission_required = 'myapp.view_user'
```

In the above code, we've defined a class-based view called `CustomUserDetailView` that extends Django's built-in `DetailView` class. We've also used two mixins: `LoginRequiredMixin` and `PermissionRequiredMixin`. 

The `LoginRequiredMixin` mixin ensures that the user is logged in before they can access the view. The `PermissionRequiredMixin` mixin checks that the user has the `view_user` permission defined in `CustomGroup`.

We've also specified the `model`, `template_name`, and `context_object_name` attributes, which are standard attributes used in Django's `DetailView`. Finally, we've specified the `permission_required` attribute to specify the permission required to access the view.

You can then add a URL pattern to map the view to a URL:

```python
# urls.py
from django.urls import path
from myapp.views import CustomUserDetailView

urlpatterns = [
    path('user/<int:pk>/', CustomUserDetailView.as_view(), name='user_detail'),
]
```

In the above code, we've defined a URL pattern that maps the `CustomUserDetailView` view to a URL with the `<int:pk>` parameter, which is used to fetch the `CustomUser` object with the specified primary key.

You can then use the `CustomUserDetailView` view in your Django templates like this:

```html
<!-- user_detail.html -->
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
    {% if perms.myapp.view_user %}
        <h1>User Details</h1>
        <p>Phone Number: {{ user.phone_number }}</p>
        <p>Email: {{ user.email }}</p>
    {% else %}
        <p>You don't have permission to view this user's details.</p>
    {% endif %}
{% endblock %}
```

In the above code, we're using the `perms` template variable to check if the user has the `view_user` permission defined in `CustomGroup`. If the user has the permission, we display the user's details. If not, we display a message indicating that the user doesn't have permission to view the details.

I hope these examples help! Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or if you want me to review your code. Keep up the great work! üëç
